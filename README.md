The Flip Card Norsk App is a React-based app that helps you learn Norwegian through interactive flashcards.


Key Features:
Flashcard Mechanism: The main feature is the “flip card” system where users can switch between the Norwegian word or phrase and its English equivalent. 

The app uses React’s component-based setup. Each card works as its own component, using state management for the flipping action and keeping track of user progress. React hooks, useState, and useEffect, are used to manage the app's dynamic features.

Tailwind CSS for Styling: Responsive design comes from Tailwind CSS, giving it a modern and user-friendly vibe. 

User Authentication and Dashboard: A key feature in the works is a dashboard login system, letting users sign up, log in, and keep track of their progress*. 

Interactive Learning Experience: The app creates an engaging and user-focused learning atmosphere. By flipping through cards, users can actively interact with the material. This engagement can get an extra boost from gamified elements, which help keep motivation up and track progress.

Backend Integration (MERN Stack): While the current version focuses on front-end functionalities, the app connect with a backend system (using Express and MongoDB) to store user data, track learning progress*, and support user sessions* via a login system.
